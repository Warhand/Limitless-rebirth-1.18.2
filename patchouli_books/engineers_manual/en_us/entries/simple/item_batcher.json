This behavior can be adjusted with the button labeled 'Output Mode'. $(br)The default behavior noted above is known as $(#007500)batched mode$().

By attaching a $(l:patchouli:power/redstone_wires#interface)Redstone Interface Connector$(), the Item Batcher will send signals along the redstone wires when a filter is satisfied. $(br)This allows you to disable any extracting conveyors or producing machinery when your required amount of items is reached. Note that if multiple filters use the same colour, they all need to be satisfied for a signal to be sent."
