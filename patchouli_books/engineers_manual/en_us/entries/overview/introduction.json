This journal shall serve as your guide for setting up all the new machines and functions this mod has to offer. $(br)Let's start with the basics first: Immersive Engineering is built around the concept of retrofuturistic generation and transfer of energy. The energy used in this mod is Forge Energy, a trait shared with many other mods currently available."

			"text": "Energy is transmitted between connectors by the use of wires. Wires can only bridge a limited distance of blocks, so you will need to use more connectors as relays between the wires. $(br)You have the choice between three different types of wire, which differ in transferrates, 2048, 8192, 32768 Flux/tick. To switch between different types of wire, you will need to use transformers."
