To do so, you will need a $(l:patchouli:overview/crafting_components#plate)backplane$(), some vacuum tubes and some solder like lead or copper wires. The table also needs to be supplied with energy through the input at its back. Using the various components, you then select the pattern of circuit you want to make and decide the input values, as well as the designated output."
